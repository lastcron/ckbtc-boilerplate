# Welcome to ckBTC-PaymentConnector!

Hello There! ‚úåüèΩ This project implements transactions in [ckBTC](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/bitcoin/ckbtc), a cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin blockchain. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how transactions can be implemented in a cryptocurrency in a secure and efficient manner.

## Run Locally

#### Docker installation

At first rename the `.env-example` to `.env`, then:

Build the image:
```bash
  npm run docker:build
```
Start all services:
```bash
  npm run docker:up
```

or

#### Manual installation

We have to create a mysql container, if you want to use another instance, just change the variables in the `.env` file.

```bash
  npm run docker:up:db
```
